You can then open the generated `youtube_links.html` in any web browser!

OR resume from a previous conversion (see [Limitations](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/spotimy/blob/main/README.md#limitations) below for why this might be needed/helpful):
```bash
python spotimy.py --resume Spotify_playlist-to-Youtube_playlist.json
```

AND you can add tracks from a tracklist to a new or existing Spotify playlist (see [Hints](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/spotimy/blob/main/README.md#hints) below for tips on using this feature):

# Known bugs and limitations
### Bugs
Since this tool works by adding the first video from the YouTube search of format `Track Title - Artist Name (Album: Album Name)`, mistakes are bound to happen. One problem that seems to be pretty common is that "Full Album" videos get added when a song is also an album name.

Example: `Colour Green - Sibylle Baier (Album: Colour Green)` adds the video [Sibylle Baier - Colour Green (Full Album)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xVw7BEnkEI)

### Limitations
The API requests are limited. At the time of writing, (April 14th, 2025), I've only been able to convert 68 Spotify tracks into YouTube playlist items before hitting the API daily rate limit.

# Hints
Spotify deprecated being able to get the tracks from their currated playlists. This little javascript code snippet can be used to extract all of the `href` targets from the `<a>` tags when you open those playlist pages in your browser, zoom ALLLLL the way out so that every track is loaded and visible, and then dumping those into a file.

```
const trackLinks = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a'))
                        .map(a => a.getAttribute('href'))
                        .filter(href => href && href.includes('track'))
                        .map(href => href.split('/track/')[1]);

console.log(trackLinks.join('\n'));
```

Example workflow using Chrome:
1. Go to the playlist in the web browser.
1. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` to enter the browser's web inspector.
1. Using the element explorer, highlight the `<div`> element that contains the playlist track listing and right click to "cut" it into your clipboard.
1. Delete the entire `<body>` element
1. Append (paste) the `<div>` from your clipboard.
1. Go to the web inspector's "Console" to paste the javascript snippet above.
1. Copy and paste the results into a text file.
